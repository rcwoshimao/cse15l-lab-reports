## Part 1: Debugging Scenario 
### Original Post
Title: Initialization error when trying to run ArrayTests for lab 3
Post content: 
Hello! As seen in screenshot below, I was trying to run the tests for my ArrayeExamples, but the code keeps on giving me an initialization error. I double checked and the path to the files and junit test look fine, and I also have my lib file. I checked my code and all my code look fine too. I suspect the error is in the way I ran the commands. are there any fixes to this?
